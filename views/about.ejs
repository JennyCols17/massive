                <div class="space-y-6 text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                    <p>
                        Massiveparts Inc. started its humble beginnings in 1959, when two brothers decided to put up an auto parts shop called Chuan Lam Auto Supply carrying European auto parts.  During that time, European vehicles were widely used for public transportation (taxi cabs) and by private users.  Guided by a couple of industrious, diligent, and religious parents and with the rest of the siblings joining forces, they boldly embarked on an uncharted course.</p>
                    <p>
                        Years later, Japanese vehicles started flooding the market, encroaching upon the market share of European cars. This prompted the company to venture into Japanese automobile parts, focusing on passenger vehicles and 4-cylinder pick up trucks for Toyota, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Nissan, Isuzu and recently, Honda models.</p>
                    <p>
                        As roads expanded, cities connected and economy leaps forward, the company saw the need to cater to a growing market.  It has since expanded its products to include parts for Korean vehicles such as Kia, Hyundai, Daewoo and Ssangyong models.  Through the availability of major and minor spare parts to the market at reasonable prices, the company was able establish a niche in the auto after-market industry.</p>
                    <p>
	                    Over the years, the company climbed from its humble beginnings to present rank, as one of the major distributors of automotive spare parts in the Philippines. This is attributed to its commitment to provide customers with product quality and availability at reasonable prices.                  </div>
